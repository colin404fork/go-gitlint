# go-gitlint
Go lint your commit messages!

## Requirements

As an architect of other (non-golang) projects hosted on GitHub I need:

* Commit titles merged to the development branch conform to an arbitrary regex
* Commit titles to include the issue's ID
* Commit bodies merged to the development branch conform to an arbitrary regex
